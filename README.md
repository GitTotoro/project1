# Predicting Bakery Sales Trends Using Weather Data In Seoul

This project explores the relationship between weather conditions and bakery sales using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a predictive model that forecasts daily sales based on historical sales data and weather features.

📌 Project Overview

Dataset: Bakery Sales Data (Kaggle)

Weather Data: Meteostat

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost


🔍 Key Steps

Data Preprocessing:
Merged sales and weather datasets based on timestamps
Handled missing values and standardized features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualized sales trends and weather variations
Analyzed correlations between temperature and sales

Modeling & Prediction:
Implemented regression models (Linear Regression, XGBoost)
Evaluated model performance using RMSE and R²

Findings:
Temperature had a limited direct impact on sales
Time-series patterns and external factors (e.g., holidays) played a significant role
